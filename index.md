## Neural Approaches toward Domain independent dialog system

Before we begin, let me introduce myself. 
Hello, my name is Sourabh Majumdar and I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS-Pilani,Goa.
This project is my undergraduate thesis and as you can probably guess, the topic is "Neural Approaches toward domain indpndent dialog system".
I am currently doing this thesis under the supervision of ![Dr. Marco Guerini](guerini@fbk.eu) at Fondazione Bruno Kessler,Trento,Italy

### Description of the project

To summarize, today's machine learning systems are highly advanced to communicate with humans in natural way. However they suffer two main problems that have not been adressed properly.

1. To Build such a system from scratch for a new domain (for e.g. creating a chat bot for a new company customer care) we need often need training data for the system which is not always available.

2. Once we have data for a new domain, it causes problems to scale to new domain because we need to re-train everything.

My undergraduate thesis tries to adress the problem by suggesting an end-to-end architecture that tries to solve both of these problems.

### Resources

Currently my project is inspired from the following papers

1. ![Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3916)
2. ![End to End Memory Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895)
3. ![Dialog Self Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04871)

### Architecture

I propose a multiple memory network architecture inspied from the first two links.
To create the data I take inspiration from the third link.
